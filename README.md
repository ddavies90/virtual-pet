# Virtual Pet

## Summary of the Project
This project was part of the OOP section of the Manchester Codes Software Engineer FastTrack course. The aim was to create a pet object which has the following functionality:

- You can give them a name

- They can get older

- As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit

- You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness.

- You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. 

- You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking.

- If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE :(

- If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE :(

- It can have children and store reference to its kids.
